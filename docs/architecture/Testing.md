# Testing Documentation

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the testing strategies and tools used for the LinkMe project. It encompasses unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, and performance tests to ensure the project's robustness and reliability.

---

## Testing Strategies

### Unit Testing

Unit tests focus on individual units of code (like functions or methods) to ensure that they perform as expected.

- **Backend (FastAPI)**: `pytest`
- **Frontend (ReactJS)**: `Jest`

---

### Integration Testing

Integration tests ensure that different components or services of the application work together as intended.

- **Tools Used**: `pytest` with `TestClient` for FastAPI integration tests

---

### End-to-End Testing

End-to-end tests validate the flow of an application, ensuring the entire process of user input and application output works seamlessly.

- **Tools Used**: `Cypress` or `Selenium` for web-based end-to-end tests

---

### Performance Testing

Performance tests evaluate the responsiveness, reliability, and scalability of an application under a specific load.

- **Tools Used**: `Locust` or `JMeter`

---

## Test Coverage

We aim for a minimum of 80% test coverage for both backend and frontend components. Code coverage tools ensure we maintain this standard.

- **Backend**: `coverage.py`
- **Frontend**: Coverage feature of `Jest`

---

## Continuous Integration

All tests are integrated into our CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that tests are run automatically with every commit or pull request.

- **Tools Used**: `GitHub Actions`

---

## Mocking and Stubbing

To isolate components and services during testing, we employ mocking and stubbing for dependencies.

- **Backend**: `unittest.mock`
- **Frontend**: Mocking features of `Jest`

---

## Testing Environments

- **Local Environment**: Developers run unit tests and some integration tests locally before pushing to the repository.
- **Staging Environment**: Mimics the production environment. All types of tests are run here before deploying to production.

## Best Practices

1. **Write Tests Early**: Aim to write tests alongside the feature or functionality development.
2. **Keep Tests DRY**: Avoid redundancy. Use fixtures, setup, and teardown methods effectively.
3. **Readable Test Names**: Test names should clearly state what they are testing and what the expected outcome is.
4. **Isolate Tests**: Ensure one test does not depend on another. Tests should be isolated and able to run in any order.
5. **Review Test Failures**: Before diving into fixing a test, understand why it failed.
